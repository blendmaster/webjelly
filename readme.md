# Web G-ell-y

`webjelly` dynamically renders 3d models from a simple input
format, allowing rotation, zooming, and shading mode switching. `webjelly`
should run on all modern browsers with WebGL enabled.

This is Steven Ruppert's Project 2 for the fall 2012 **CSCI441 Computer
Graphics** class at the Colorado School of Mines.
